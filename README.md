# Conker Tweaks
A Python-powered web app for product management and orders with user auth and a clean UI. This README is a starting point tailored from your repo layout (see folders below).

## ✨ Features
- User authentication (login/register), profiles, and sessions
- Products & orders modules
- API routes and view layer
- Form validation & (optional) reCAPTCHA
- SQLite database by default (`conker.db`), easy to switch to Postgres/MySQL
- Static assets for styling under `static/`

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack
- **Python 3.10+**
- **Web framework:** defined in `requirements.txt` (the project is structured to run with a standard WSGI/ASGI app in `main.py`/`start.py`)
- **Database:** SQLite (dev) via `conker.db`
- **Environment:** `.env` for secrets/config
- **Deps:** see `requirements.txt`

## 🚀 Getting Started (Local)

### 1) Clone & setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PeterTech-Dev/Conker-Tweaks.git
cd Conker-Tweaks

# create & activate a virtual env (Windows PowerShell shown; adjust for macOS/Linux)
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1   # Windows
# source .venv/bin/activate    # macOS/Linux

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2) Environment variables
Copy or create a `.env` file (example values):
```bash
APP_ENV=development
SECRET_KEY=change-this
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///conker.db
RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=
RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY=
```
> If you keep using SQLite, `DATABASE_URL` can be `sqlite:///conker.db` (relative) or `sqlite:////absolute/path/to/conker.db`.

### 3) Initialize the database
```bash
python init_db.py
# or, if migrations/seeders are included, run them here
```

### 4) Run the app
Try one of the following depending on your entry point:

```bash
# Typical runner
python start.py

# Or directly (if main.py exposes app)
python main.py

# If ASGI app is named `app` inside main.py:
# uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```
Open: <http://127.0.0.1:8000> (or the port printed by your runner).

---

## 🧪 Testing (optional)
Add tests (pytest) and document how to run them here:
```bash
pytest -q
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration Notes
- Set proper secrets in `.env` for production.
- Replace SQLite with a hosted DB by changing `DATABASE_URL` and updating your DB client/ORM.
- If you use reCAPTCHA, ensure keys are set and network access is allowed.
- Static files are served from `static/`; see **License** below for attribution requirements.
